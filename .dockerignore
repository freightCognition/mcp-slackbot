             # If it was not to be copied, it would be ignored.

# Final cleanup: ensure only files needed for runtime are included.
# If pyproject.toml and requirements.txt are only for build stage,
# they could be ignored *if* using multi-stage Docker builds and they aren't needed later.
# For this simple Dockerfile, requirements.txt is needed. pyproject.toml might be if uv uses it.
# Let's keep pyproject.toml for now.

# Ensure the .github directory is ignored for the build context
